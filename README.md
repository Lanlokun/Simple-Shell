# Simple Shell Project By Malik K Lanlokun and Okuhle Nsibande

As part of the peer projects under the ALX curriculum , we have been assigned to write a simple shell program that emulates the original unix shell and can perform most of it's basic operations.

Written in C

##  Compilation

Enter the following commands into your terminal :

 ```
    gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o shs
    ./shs

 ```


## Usage

 After running the above commands , if everyting works fine you should see a prompt on your terminal to enter commands.
 Now you can enter any of the unix commands ( please note that pipe commands are not working yet!)

## Sample commands

1. ls
2. mkdir test
3. ls- la
4. ls -l
5. pwd


## Features

        Executes single commands and  multiple valid command line arguments
        Handles errors
        Handles EOF & EXIT
        HANDLES ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
