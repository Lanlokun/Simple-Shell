- fixed double/infinite prompt
- rearranged while & buff malloc
  : malloc size issue
  : legibility
  : eval getlline return val
- currently (Ctrl+D x2 breaks - it shouldn't)
- handled cd func (returns back to parent process)
  : needs more work (perhaps env vars) 
    + to work when shell is executed from a different file
	+ update env vars
